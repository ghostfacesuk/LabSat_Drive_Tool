https://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsd/files/Ext2fsd/0.69/

Update PATH environment variable: If ext2fsd is installed correctly but the command is not recognized, you might need to add its directory to the system's PATH environment variable. You can do this by following these steps:

Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties".
Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left side.
In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
In the Environment Variables window, select the "Path" variable under "System variables" and click on "Edit".
Add the directory where ext2fsd is installed to the list of paths. For example, if ext2fsd is installed in C:\Program Files\ext2fsd, add C:\Program Files\ext2fsd to the list.
Click "OK" to save the changes and close all windows.
Restart your computer: After updating the PATH environment variable, restart your computer to apply the changes.
